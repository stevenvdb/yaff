# First import the Numpy library
import numpy as np

# Then import the h5py library. h5py is used to access HDF5 files from Python
# scripts. The HDF5 file format is an international standard to efficiently
# store large amounts of array data in a cross-platform file. In Yaff it is
# mainly used to store trajectory data, i.e. the state of the molecular system
# at each step of the an iterative algorithm such as a geometry optimization or
# a molecular dynamics simulation.
import h5py as h5

# Finally load the Yaff library.
from yaff import *

# The amount of output printed on screen can be controlled by uncommenting one
# of the following lines:
#log.set_level(log.debug)
#log.set_level(log.high)
#log.set_level(log.medium) # The default
#log.set_level(log.low)
#log.set_level(log.silent)

# For convenience, the units for pressure and energy are defined here:
p_unit = 1e9*pascal
e_unit = electronvolt

# Load the initial state from the file created by the script init/mksystem.py
system = System.from_file('../init/init.chk')

# Construct a force-field model for the quartz system using the BKS parameters.
# In addition to the force-field parameters, several additional technical
# parameters may be provided to tune the accuracy and efficiency of the
# evaluation of the force-field energy and its partial derivatives, namely the
# Cartesian forces and the (static contribution to) the virial tensor.
#
# rcut
#   The real-space cutoff for the non-bonding interactions. (Both Van der Waals
#   and short-range electrostatics.)
#
# alpha_scale
#   A dimensionless parameter that controls alpha in the Ewald summation method:
#   alpha = alpha_scale/rcut.
#
# gcut_scale
#   A dimensionless parameter to control the cutoff for the reciprocal terms
#   in the Ewald summation: gcut = gcut_scale*alpha.
#
# smooth_ei
#   If True, the real-space term in the Ewald sum is smoothened in the same way
#   is the other non-bonding interactions. This may reduce numerical artifacts
#   during the optimization.
#
# skin
#   The skim parameter
#
# reci_ewald
#   Method for the computation of the reciprocal term in the Ewald sum. For now,
#   only 'ewald' and 'ignore' are supported.

# Define the optimization algorithm.
#
# CGOptimizer
#   A conjugate gradient optimizer
#
# StrainCellDOF
#   A definition of the degrees of freedom (DOF) that are subject to
#   optimization. Strain refers to the fact that cell rotations are excluded.
#
# gpos_rms=1e-6
#   The convergence condition for the nuclear positions. Only with the RMS value
#   of the nuclear gradient vector drops below this threshold, the optimization
#   may be converged. (Several other criteria are also implicitly used.)
#
# grvecs_rms=1e-6
#   Similar to previous, but now for the derivative of the energy towards the
#   components of the cell vectors.
#
# hooks
#   A list of extra 'things' that need to be done during the opmization. In this
#   case, just the generation of trajectory files.
