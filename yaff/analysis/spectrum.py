    def __init__(self, f=None, start=0, end=-1, step=1, bsize=4096, select=None,
                 path='trajectory/vel', key='vel', outpath=None, weights=None):
        """
           **Optional arguments:**

           f
                An h5.File instance containing the trajectory data. If ``f``
                is not given, or it does not contain the dataset referred to
                with the ``path`` argument, an on-line analysis is carried out.

           start
                The first sample to be considered for analysis. This may be
                negative to indicate that the analysis should start from the
                -start last samples.

           end
                The last sample to be considered for analysis. This may be
                negative to indicate that the last -end sample should not be
                considered.

           step
                The spacing between the samples used for the analysis

           bsize
                The size of the blocks used for individual FFT calls.

           select
                A list of atom indexes that are considered for the computation
                of the spectrum. If not given, all atoms are used.

           path
                The path of the dataset that contains the time dependent data in
                the HDF5 file. The first axis of the array must be the time
                axis. The spectra are summed over the other axes.

           key
                In case of an on-line analysis, this is the key of the state
                item that contains the data from which the spectrum is derived.

           outpath
                The output path for the frequency computation in the HDF5 file.
                If not given, it defaults to '%s_spectrum' % path. If this path
                already exists, it will be removed first.

           weights
                If not given, the spectrum is just a simple sum of contributions
                from different time-dependent functions. If given, a linear
                combination is made based on these weights.

           The max_sample argument from get_slice is not used because the choice
           step value is an important parameter: it is best to choose step*bsize
           such that it coincides with a part of the trajectory in which the
           velocities (or other data) are continuous.

           The block size should be set such that it corresponds to a decent
           resolution on the frequency axis, i.e. 33356 fs of MD data
           corresponds to a resolution of about 1 cm^-1. The step size should be
           set such that the highest frequency is above the highest relevant
           frequency in the spectrum, e.g. a step of 10 fs corresponds to a
           frequency maximum of 3336 cm^-1. The total number of FFT's, i.e.
           length of the simulation divided by the block size multiplied by the
           number of time-dependent functions in the data, determines the noise
           reduction on the (the amplitude of) spectrum. If there is sufficient
           data to perform 10K FFT's, one should get a reasonably smooth
           spectrum.

           Depending on the FFT implementation in numpy, it may be interesting
           to tune the bsize argument. A power of 2 is typically a good choice.

           When f is None, or when the path does not exist in the HDF5 file, the
           class can be used as an on-line analysis hook for the iterative
           algorithms in yaff.sampling package. This means that the spectrum
           is built up as the iterative algorithm progresses. The end option is
           ignored for an on-line analysis.
