"""Short-range scaling of pairwise interactions

   The ``Scalings`` class describe scaling or exclusion of short-range
   non-bonding pairwise interactions for atom pairs that are involved in
   covalent energy terms.

   A ``Scaling`` object can be attached to any ``ForcePartPair`` class and,
   as a special case, also to the ``ForcePartEwaldCorrection``. A ``Scaling``
   object describes which 1-2 (scale1), 1-3 (scale2) and 1-4 (scale3) pairs
   should have their interactions scaled down or excluded (scaling=0.0).

   In order to avoid ambiguities, each scaled pair should only correspond to
   one unique bond path to the periodic image. If this is not the case an
   ``AssertionError`` is raised to inform the user that he/she should switch to
   a larger supercell. Yaff can simply not handle such cases correctly. (The
   same problem may be present in other codes, but we do not know to what extent
   they handle such cases gracefully.)
