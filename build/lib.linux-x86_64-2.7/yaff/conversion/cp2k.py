       f
            An open and writable HDF5 file.

       fn_ener
            The filename of the CP2K energy trajectory file.

       **Optional arguments:**

       sub
            This must be a slice object that defines the sub-sampling of the
            CP2K energy file. By default all time steps are read.

       This routine will also test the consistency of the row attribute of the
       trajectory group. If some trajectory data is already present, it will be
       replaced by the new data. Furthermore, this routine also checks the
       header of the CP2K energy file to make sure the values are interpreted
       correctly.

       It is highly recommended to first initialize the HDF5 file with the
       ``to_hdf5`` method of the System class.
