            By default this is False, which means that the changes in fractional
            atomic coordinates due to cell deformations are properly taken into
            account. When this is set to True, such displacements (other than
            uniform scaling) are ignored. The latter is much faster, but only
            correct for the simplest materials.

       ridge
            Threshold for the eigenvalues of the Cartesian Hessian. This only
            matters if ``do_frozen==False``.

       The elastic constants are second order derivatives of the strain energy
       density with respect to uniform deformations. At the molecular scale,
       uniform deformations can be describe by a linear transformation of the
       atoms and the cell parameters::

            x' = e . x0

       When x0 corresponds to the reference point for the second order
       expansion, small deviations from that reference point correspond to small
       deviations of e from the unit matrix. The strain energy density is
       nothing but the energy of the system divided by its volume, minus a the
       energy density of the fully relaxed system. The adjective `strain` refers
       to deviations from the relaxed reference. When computing the second order
       derivatives, this reference point can be ignored. Assuming the reference
       point is the relaxed system, the strain energy density can be
       approximated to second order as::

           u = 1/2 \sum_ijkl e_ij c_ijkl e_kl

       In this equation the matrix c_ijkl contains all the elastic constants.
       In principle, it contains 81 values, but due to symmetry considerations,
       only 21 of these values are independent. [The symmetry considerations are
       as follows: (i) it is sufficient to consider symmetric deformations e
       when excluding cell rotations, (ii) the index pairs (ij) and (kl) are
       interchangeable.] These 21 numbers are typically represented using the
       (inclusive) lower diagonal of a 6x6 matrix, using the following
       convention to map pair indexes (ij) and (kl) onto single indexes n and m:

       ============ ======
       (ij) or (kl) n or m
       ============ ======
       11           1
       22           2
       22           3
       23           4
       31           5
       12           6
       ============ ======

       (This table is also known as the compressed Voight notation.)

       This routine returns the elastic constants in a symmetric 6x6 matrix,
       using the index conventions by Voight.
